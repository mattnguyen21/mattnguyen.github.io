      <p>Los Angeles Metropolitan &amp; Inland Empire based Photographer. Photography has always been a part of his life. Whether it's Yearbook, College Classes, Events, or even Theme Park shenanigans... he is always there to capture the moment.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Matt has used every opportunity he has to take his camera on adventures! One of his biggest portfolio is Theme Park Photography (TPP). TPP is all about cappturing hidden moments between stunt performer/actors like to add in between.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It started Freshman Year of High School when he suddently had the urge to take pictures of everything. Friends, Events, Family. This grew into a hobby. This lef him to take Yearbook Senior Yerar and a few courses in community college.</p>
      <p>He recently just bought a Nikon D7400 as a wedding was approaching. He has wanted to own his personal camera for a while now. He has been using his Dad's (Nikon 5200) since High School. He thought it would be the perfect opportunity to finally get his own camera to shoot at a friend's wedding as well as take it on adventures!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
